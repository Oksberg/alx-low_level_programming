This README file explains the tasks executed in this project on Recursion.

       Task 0
------------------
This function writes prints a string followed by a new line.
Printf and puts functions were not used but a created _putchar was used to print the string to stdout.

       Task 1
------------------




       Task 2
------------------


       Task 3
------------------
This function calculates and returns the factorial of a given number knowing that the factorial of 0 is 1. It returns -1 if the given number is negative. Like the other tasks, the recursive method was deployed here.

       Task 4
------------------
This function evaluates a number x raised to the power y recursively and returns the value. It also returns -1 if y is negative.

       Task 5
------------------
This function returns the natural square root of a number. It returns -1 if the number does not have a natural square root. It uses recursion.

       Task 6
------------------
This task creates a recursive function that determines whether or not a number is a prime number.
